I’m Furqan, a data scientist with expertise in neuroscience, medical signal processing, AR/VR, and embedded systems. I have a track record of innovation and extensive experience in designing and developing cutting-edge technologies, as well as leading multidisciplinary teams of data scientists and software engineers.

Currently, I’m working at the University of California, Davis, where I leverage my expertise to innovate in brain-machine interfaces and wearables. Previously, I worked at META Innovation Lab, contributing to AR/VR projects and pioneering early migraine prediction using wearable time series sensor data.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from UC Davis, focusing on biological decoding and neural interfaces. My research and professional contributions have been recognized with publications and industry accolades.

I’m seeking full-time roles in Data Science or Software Engineering where I can apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. I’m also open to collaborations on exciting projects.
